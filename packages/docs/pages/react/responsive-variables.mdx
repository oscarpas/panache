# Responsive variables

With responsive variables you can bind CSS values to media query rules. Define a responsive variable as an array:

```jsx
['10px', ['@media (min-width: 768px)', '20px']]
```

The values of the array can either be a string, which will be parsed as the default value. Or it can be a tuple which will be parsed as responsive value. The first value of the tuple should be a media query rule and the second a value you want to bind to the rule.

You can add as many responsive values as you want, but only one default:

```jsx
[
  '10px',
  ['@media (min-width: 768px)', '20px'],
  ['@media (min-width: 1024px)', '30px'],
]
```

### Example 1: Consistent and adaptive white space across devices

Say you have a value that you want to use for white space in your layout, such as paddings and margins. This value will be used for multiple CSS properties. It should be consistent across the entire layout, and it should change depending on viewport width.

To solve this, define a responsive variable. In this example `15px` is used as the default value, and `30px` is bound to a breakpoint.

(In these examples we prefix reponsive variables with `$`, this is just to remind our self that they are responsive. You can name them as you please.)

```jsx
const media = {
  small: '@media(min-width: 768px)',
}

const theme = {
  $space: ['15px', [media.small, '30px']],
}
```

You can then use the variable for any CSS property, in any component. The value will be consistent and change depending on breakpoint.

```jsx
const MyThing = lib.div(({ them }) => ({
	padding: theme.$space,
	marginTop: theme.$space,
}))
```

When parsed the CSS output will be:

```css
.MyThing {
	padding: 15px;
	margin-top: 15px;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
	.MyThing {
		padding: 30px;
		margin-top: 30px;
	}
}
```

### Example 2: Easy dark/light mode based on the users preference

Dark mode is becoming more and more popular and many devices let's the user set their preference for which mode they prefer.

With responsive variables it's easy to adapt your colors based on the user. We'll add a media query rule which detects if a user prefers dark mode, then we'll bind CSS values to this rule.

The primary color used for text will be black by default, if the user prefers a dark mode it will change to white. Same goes for the background color, but the other way around.

```jsx
const media = {
  dark: '@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)',
}

const theme = {
  colors: {
    $primary: ['black', [media.dark, 'white']],
    $background: ['white', [media.dark, 'black']]
  }
}
```

Use the variables in your components.

```jsx
const MyThing = lib.div(({ theme }) => ({
	color: theme.colors.$primary,
	backgroundColor: theme.colors.$background,
}))
```

And it will result in the following CSS when parsed.

```css
.MyThing {
  color: 'black',
  backgroun-color: 'white'
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .MyThing {
    color: 'white',
    backgroun-color: 'black'
  }
}
```
