Panache.js is a library for writing CSS as React components. Panache is heavily inspired by Styled Components but it lets you write your CSS as Objects. 

Writing CSS as objects enables additional features such as:
- **Easy syntax:** One function to access props, themes and media breakpoints.
- **Share and extend styles:** Easily extend and share style objects across components with the spread operator.
- **Reponsive variables:** Bind CSS values to one or multiple media breakpoints.
- **Type safe:** Write type safe styles.

And just like Styled Components it comes with features such as:
- **Auto critical CSS**
- **Dynamic styling based on props**
- **Easy maintenance:** Styles are coupled to your component
