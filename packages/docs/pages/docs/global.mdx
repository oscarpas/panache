import { createGlobalStyle, PanacheProvider } from '@panache/react'

# Global styles

Panache is component scoped by design but sometimes it can be helpful to add global styles such as resets or base styles.

You can use the helper function `createGlobalStyle` to do this. It works like the regular component creator and you have access to your `theme`, `media` and other props in the same way.

```jsx
import { createGlobalStyle } from '@panache/react'

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle(({ theme }) => ({
  html: {
    fontSize: '20px',
    fontFamily: theme.fonts.primary
  },
}))
```

Then add the `GlobalStyle` at the top of your app tree, but inside your provider.

```jsx
<PanacheProvider theme={theme} media={media}>
  <GlobalStyle />
  <App />
</PanacheProvider>
```

### Reset CSS

Panache has a helper package with a CSS reset based on Eric Meyers famous reset file, but formatted as a Style Object. To use the reset first install the package:

```bash
# with npm
npm install --save @panache/reset

# with yarn
yarn add @panache/reset
```

Then import and pass the reset to `createGlobalStyle` as the second argument. This will merge the reset with your own global styles. Your styles will take precedent if you target the same selector and CSS property.

```jsx
import { createGlobalStyle } from '@panache/react'
import reset from '@panache/reset'

const globalStyles = ({ theme }) => ({
  html: {
    fontSize: '20px',
    fontFamily: theme.fonts.primary
  },
})

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle(globalStyles, reset)
```

If you prefer another reset you can also pass in your own as long as it's formatted as a Styled Object.
